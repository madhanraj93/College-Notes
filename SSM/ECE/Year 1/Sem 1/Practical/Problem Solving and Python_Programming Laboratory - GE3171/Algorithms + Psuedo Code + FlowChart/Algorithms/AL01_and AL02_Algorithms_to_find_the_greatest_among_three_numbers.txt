Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read the three numbers A,B,C
Step 3: Compare A and B. If A is the greatest perfom step 4 else perform Step 5.
Step 4: Compare A and C. If A is greatest, output "A is the greatest" else output "C is the greatest".
Step 5: Compare B and C. If B is the greatest, output "B is the greatest" else output "C is the greatest"
Step 6: Stop

ii)

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read the three numbers A,B,C
Step 3: Compare A and B. If A is the greatest, store A in MAX, else store B in MAX
Step 4: Compare MAX and C. IF MAX is the greatest, out "MAX is the greatest" else output "C is the greatest".
